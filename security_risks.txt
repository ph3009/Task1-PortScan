## Port 80 — HTTP

 What: Unsecure web service (web pages).

 Risk: Outdated web apps → attackers can exploit.

 Fix: Use HTTPS, update software, protect admin pages.


## Port 443 — HTTPS

 What: Secure web service (TLS).

 Risk: Bad TLS config or expired cert → security issues.

 Fix: Renew certs, use modern TLS settings.

## Port 1900 — UPnP (SSDP)

 What: Device discovery for smart devices.

 Risk: Can reveal devices or be abused if exposed externally.

 Fix: Disable UPnP on router if not needed; update firmware.

## Port 7443 — ORACLE-HTTPS (alt HTTPS)

 What: Alternate HTTPS (often admin/management).

 Risk: Admin panels exposed → default creds or vulnerabilities.

 Fix: Restrict to VPN, change default passwords, patch.

## Port 8080 — HTTP-PROXY / Alt HTTP

 What: Alternate web/app port (proxies, admin consoles).

 Risk: Open proxy or vulnerable app → abuse or data leak.

 Fix: Close if unused, enable auth, update app.

## Port 8443 — HTTPS-ALT

 What: Alternate HTTPS (apps/admin).

 Risk: Same as 443 — exposed admin panels or old TLS.

 Fix: Restrict access, use VPN, update TLS and app.
